I've developed and published several indie minigames and prototypes on my own as well as collaborating with artists, designers and other programmers.\nI've been playing videogames almost everyday since I was able to grab a controller, which has given me a lot of experience about the mechanics and designs of lots of genres. I'm also a usual pen 'n paper player and game master, as well as a long fan of card and board games.\nMy background working with web technologies helped me develop my coding and interpersonal skills, collaborating with different departments and clients."
